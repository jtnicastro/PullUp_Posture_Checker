# Pull Up Posture Checker
This project is a Python script that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to process a video of a person performing pull ups. Users can upload a video of themselves performing pull ups and the program detects shoulder elevations and arm angles, provides real-time feedback on muscular symmetry, and counts repetitions.

## Features
+ **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays angles of arm lifts and notifies if arms are uneven or if shoulders are elevated.
+ **Repetition Counting**: Counts the number of full-range arm lift repetitions.
+ **Output Video: Annotates** the input video with arm angles, shoulder elevation percentages, and repetition count.
